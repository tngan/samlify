## What is Single Sign On (SSO) ?

SSO is an access control strategy for multiple applications. Just imagine that you have to log-in different internal systems in a company every morning. It's really annoying when you type your account name and password. Also you imagine if you were the guy in IT department. Every time a new employee is hired, you have to create an account information for each internal systems. It turns out that really difficult to manage the credentials.

By using SSO, user can memorize one set of credential to log-in an **Identity Provider** for authentication. User can access those systems because of the trust-worthy relationship among IdP and those systems.
